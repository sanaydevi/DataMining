Detection of hand movements used by deaf people to communicate using Myo armband 

Performed feature extraction and Feature selection using PCA. Designed classification machines to separate the hand gestures as useful or not using Decision tree, SVM and Neural Networks in MATLAB. 

Report4.pdf depicts the results of our hand gesture classficiation and graphs related to it.
